Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning
Computer vision is an evolving discipline that represents a dynamic domain within computer science, centering on the interpretation of visual data. This area has been brought back to life in recent years through neural networks and deep learning approaches. In this project, I explore how neural nets work on a simple numeric data classification problem using the MNIST data. The MNIST dataset is a set of 70,000 images, 28 x 28 pixels, of which 60,000 are training images plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the 1980s. The images are encoded as NumPy arrays, and there are 10 classes of digits ranging from 0 to 9 (Medium, 2020).
The MNIST problem is a machine learning challenge that entails the classification of the digits (0-9). The problem has often been used to evaluate machine learning models. Similarly, in this study, we leverage the MNIST dataset to assess and explore diverse neural network architectures. Our objective is to scrutinize alternative neural network structures and their efficacy in digit classification tasks. By training multiple neural network models with the training data and subsequently evaluating their accuracy, we aim to compare and appraise their performance.
